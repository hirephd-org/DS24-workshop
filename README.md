# Project Overview
This project will analyze the World Happiness Report, a survey of the state of global happiness. The report ranks countries based on their happiness levels, determined by factors such as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.

# Goals
Understand the dataset by performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Visualize the findings using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Practice basic data manipulation and cleaning techniques with Pandas.
Learn Git basics by cloning the repository, making changes, and pushing commits.
